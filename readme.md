##ACK:
to get proper result at first
 
clone or download - https://github.com/anjandebnath/SqliteDBwithContentProvider

then run that project. This is the actual project that contains database and content provider.

Then run this code and insert values to database.
This actually contains the basic example of 
- adding data to custom content provider.
- expose a database to other application via content provider
- update App Widget via Content provider data.

Then add the widget to home screen and see the result.
